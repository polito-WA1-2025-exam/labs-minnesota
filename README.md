# Exercise "GUESS WHO"

# Lab Journal
- Lab_01(07/03/2025): the chosen topic is Guess who. The domain for the game's items is Football Players because many attributes can be assigned to each item, for example the list of leagues in which he played, his role, the list of teams in which he played, his nationality, if his career is still active or he retired, his age, if he's left or right footed. It should be quite easy to define all the attributes of a player, and the difficulty could also manage the number of items in the grid which have some common attributes with the player to guess(so that guessing is harder because the grid is composed of many players with similar attributes)
